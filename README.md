# Night Vision Revamp

This is a mod is a vanilla friendly alternative for people who use fullbright.
---
It makes changes to Glow Berries, so they give night vision.

This fits perfectly into vanilla, because glow berries spawn in mineshafts!

### Overview
Glow berries will give 20 seconds of Night Vision.

1x **Glow Ink Sac** *&*  1x **Glow Berries** will make a **Coated Glow Berry** that will give you:
- Nausea (2 seconds)
- Night Vision (1:40 minutes)
- Glowing (8 seconds)

Sea Pickles are now edible! they will give you 5 seconds of night vision!

### Why make this?

I made this mod because my friends keep using fullbright. 

### Tips
I recommend you use this 
along with a dynamic lights mod so you can hold torches or lanterns in your offhand for light.

Also look for glow berries in mineshafts, you can farm them once you find them!
