# Night Vision Revamp

This is a mod is a vanilla friendly alternative for people who use fullbright.

It makes changes to the Glow Berries item, making them more useful for **cave diving**

Glow berries will give 20 seconds of Night Vision.

1x **Glow Ink Sac** *&*  1x **Glow Berries** will make a **Coated Glow Berry** that will give you:
- slight Nausea (3 seconds)
- Night Vision (2 minutes)
- Glowing (20 seconds)

I made this mod because my friends keep using fullbright. I recommend you use this 
along with a dynamic lights mod so you can hold torches or lanterns in your offhand for light.
